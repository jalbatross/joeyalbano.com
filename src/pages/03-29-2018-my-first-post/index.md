This is my first real post! 

I'm following a tutorial at https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/.

If all goes well, this post should have the tags programming and gatsby!

I actually spent two hours trying to get the tags to be separated by commas.

The solution was to put a toString() at the end of the markdown object that returned the array of tags!
